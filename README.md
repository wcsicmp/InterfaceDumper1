This project is provided "as is" and without any warranty. The author is not responsible for any damage, loss of data, or other issues resulting from the use of this code. P.S this meant to be a PoC that failed miserably. Firstly, race condition is awful since you have to inject dll in right time in order to get handles to dll. If you inject too early you won't get any handles. Secondly, you have to time your injection when the game thread is calling the create interface functions from dlls otherwise you won't get any info. Lastly, it seems like the interfaces are being created right after dll load, so you won't be able to get all the interfaces because this PoC gets the handles to dlls once. You can place the while loop on GetModuleHandle but the second issue will still be here anyways.
